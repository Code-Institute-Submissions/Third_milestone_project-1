Stream One Project: Data Centric Development Milestone Project - Code Institute


UX

I have designed this webpage to help readers finding good read and top ranked books on Psychology. The main aim was to provide users with a list of books as well as allowing them to add their favoriate books to the existing list and the functionality of submitting feedbacks on a specific book. I wanted the users to make a contirbution to this project by helping in its contents expansion. The idea is similar to some online form where everyone can provide help by making a collective effort. I have incoportated number of features to achieve the above goal which I will be explaining in depth in the next paragraph under the features section.
